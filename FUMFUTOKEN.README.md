- 👋 Hi, we are @fumfutoken and we reward our people for collaborating in collecting plastic wastes into our collecting centers. 
- 👀 We are interested in helping clean our communities, rivers, and oceans from plastic waste plus other types of waste that are affecting our ecosystem. We are incentivizing 
The recycling culture, by paying with FUMFU TOKENS to every collaborator helping to collect the wastes and taking it to our collecting center where we process all that waste and turn it into 
Valuable resources. 
Through our recycling system, we are going to build a cleaner and better future for everyone.
- 🌱 We are currently developing the first stage of FUMFU which is about the financing process to start building the biggest and most innovative recycling center in Latin America. 
- 💞️ We are looking to collaborate with other entrepreneurs and companies with the same interests.
